## The Boy Scouts
# TODO: ADD IMAGES
*Philmont’s History did not end when Waite Phillips donated the land to the BSA, nor has the ranch remained the same. The scouts have created and retired camps and have left trails zigzagging across the land than no longer appear on any map. They, like all those who came before left behind traces of the past, even in camps that are still used.*

#### INDIAN WRITINGS
IW claims to be the oldest staff camp, excluding Ponil basecamp. This long history has left it with some traces of the early scouts. This can bee seen in the IW museum, which was built by the early scouts and filled with artifacts that they found in excavations in the area.

Unfortunately, Leave No Trace has not always been the BSA’s strength and the early scouts left their mark on some of the Petroglyphs at Indian Writings. Several of the panels that contain significant amounts of graffiti are not shown to crews on the tour.

#### STONY POINT
Given its proximity as the tallest point in the Ponil area is isn’t surprising that it was used as a camp in the 1940’s. While the program was drastically different from the backpacking Philmont does to day scouts still moved around the ranch and stayed in different locations. Supposedly to the south of Hart Peak the remains of the cooking area of the original campsite can still be found. The scouts also led to the peak’s name change. Supposedly, Hart was a seasonal staffer and joked to a surveyor that it was Hart Peak. The surveyor took his word for it and it has been Hart Peak since.

#### PLANE CRASHES
While it was not the BSA that crashed the planes there are two crashes that occurred after the BSA started Philmont. One is the well know B-24 Crash on Trail peak that the Army built a trail to and dynamited, the other is the lesser known A-26 crash near the North Repeater. The B-24 became lost in a storm and impacted Trail peak while on a training mission early in WWII. The peak was along the trail between Crater Lake and Rayado Lodge, but the snow prevented quick access to the crash site. The A-26 crash occurred during the 1988 season when a pair of private pilots headed to an airshow encountered vertigo while flying through fog. Apparently attempting to gain altitude to pass over Baldy they did not realize they were in a dive and hit the back side of Copper Ridge. The wreckage is about 800ft to the northeast of the North repeater and is in much smaller pieces than the B-24. The cockpit and one of the wheels are the largest pieces of debris.

#### OLD THINGS AT CURRENT CAMPS
Several sweat lodges can be found at staffed camps. While only Apache Springs maintains and uses theirs a few can still be seen. The two best examples I’ve found are at Baldy Town where sweat lodge is near the reservoir, and Cypher’s where one is just below the Thunder mine’s north tailing pile. 

Not knowing enough about all of these to write paragraphs I’ll do bullets:
-	Miner’s Park has an old campfire bowl from its pre-climbing camp days.
-	Ponil has climbing hardware behind the commissary (and on the Petroglyph panel)
-	Head of Dean has an older cabin used by Work Crew
-	French has an outhouse that empties into a small mine.
-	Porcupine was once staffed
-	Santa Claus was until recently, when the well got too low.
-	Ponil Turnaround has a second red roof towards Penitente Canyon 
-	There is a ruined cabin of unknown origin at Vista Grande
-	There is what appears to be a mostly buried car at the Ponil Turnaround. It can be seen just beyond the fence right before the trail enters the trees.
-	Black Jack’s hideout is actually the hideout where his gang engaged in a shoot out with a Sheriff’s posse after a train robbery.

#### LINE CAMP
Line Camp has gained some notoriety amongst staff. This seems to be due to how tight-lipped ranch leadership is on the subject of the camp. Their silence has fed the stories more than any part of the camp’s history. Before there were rangers and backcountry staff, as we know it to day there where staff stationed in cabins to ensure that crews were doing okay. Line Camp appears to have been one of these locations, and since there was no program and it was changed to a trail camp before the regular backcountry program developed, there are no records of the program or camper logs. The camp was accessed through the area that now contains Carson Meadows and then scouts would hike though the UU Bar towards the Apache Springs area. When we were no longer able to use the UU Bar the only way in or out was the Carson route and this repeated trail and the depleted water source led to the camp being closed. The camp was still known to staff (and the cabin appeared on maps until 2014 or so) so BJ Leigh would have heard about it similarly to how staff learns about him today.

#### OLD CAMPS AND TRAILS
Near Porky on the trail to Big Red the remains of Brownsea Camp can be seen. They consist of the ruins of at least one cabin and a fire ring. Badger camp was used as an overflow camp for when Base go too full; it has since been abandoned. For some reason the UTMs for these two continued to be on the camp UTM sheets (as of 2017). The original western trail up Trail peak can be seen from the road with numerous sticks laid across it. According to Gene Schnell it was worse than the Fowler Pass side. If one takes the trail from the Cypher’s cabin to the Thunder mine and keeps going past the Garst and Gloria the trail bends south and heads to Lambert’s Mine camp. This was the original scouting trail. Similar trails can be found between Lambert’s and Comanche Pass. Olympia still bears the remains of the staffed camp that was there including concrete foundations near one of the first camps reached if coming from Rayado.

Further information on former camps can be found in the Philmanac.
