## The Miners
*After the end of the Civil War troops stationed in the New Mexico Territory were approached by Utes wishing to trade. They presented blue-green rocks that some soldiers recognized as copper. They asked the natives where the rocks were found and set out to find the source and make their fortune. Three of them were prospecting on the west side of Baldy when they found friendship gold. Understandably, this became the focus of their efforts and they panned the stream until they found the source and carved ‘Discovery Tree’ into a tree nearby. Without the resources or the time to do much else they planned to return the next spring. When they did they were joined by hundreds of other prospectors who had heard about the find. Eventually the region became populous enough that a new county was incorporated and Colfax County was born. Originally seated in Elizabethtown, changing times in the county saw it move to Cimarron, then Springer, and finally Raton. According to materials in the geologist box at Cyphers there were 300 deeded claims or 300 claims that were worked in some manner on Philmont property. That translates to the remains of 300 mines and prospects. Most were too small to be noticeable today, but there are enough that are that you can find dozens bushwhacking from Black Horse to French Henry.*

### BALDY DISTRICT
#### E-TOWN
Elizabethtown had a rapid rise and an even more rapid fall. When the mining in the region started in 1866 there were very few people as the miners flooded to the area it grew to over 7,000 people in 1870 at the height of the gold rush. Just two years later only 100 people remained. Today only foundations and mining equipment are left. 

This mirrored the fortunes of mining in the area. The peak in the late 1860’s led to a decline in the mid 70’s and 80’s as the quality of ore dropped to the point where it was not very cost effective to move it. This changed when the Railway passed nearby Elizabethtown. Cimarron did not get a railroad until 1905. The railway reduced the cost of transporting the ore so that the mining industry had a second wind and lasted up until the 1940s, albeit as a shadow of its height.

### BALDYTOWN
Baldytown was situated at the location of the current camp, but had districts that extended towards the Ute Meadows trail. At the camp the foundation of the hotel can be seen between the main cabin and the staff dorms. There are several early automobiles in the camp and near the corral. If one follows the small trail near the water spigot they will reach the remains of the Aztec Mill. The mill was built by Maxwell to process ore from his mines – chiefly Aztec-Ponil and Montezuma. However the mill burned down in the early 20th century and was not rebuilt due to the low productivity of the mines at the time. The foundation is still very clear at the site of the mill and a little further down hill an area filled with waste from the mill can be found with some scrap metal, tubing an the remains of some structures. If one continues along the road you will come to a flattened area that appears to have been a grave yard due to the carvings and plates in trees nearby.

The Mill in its Day

 

Returning to the camp and heading towards the shower house several metal posts can be seen to the northeast. These were likely supports for the ore carts coming from the Aztec ridge. Additional foundations can be seen in this area.

Behind the camp the Baldytown reservoir can be reached by heading to the first sharp bend on the trail to Back Horse camp and heading up the hill. There is a sweat lodge at the top of the incline and the reservoir is just past this. The reservoir has a small retaining wall and some metal parts in the trees nearby. Once at the reservoir the road that was used to reach it can be seen and followed back to the trail. However there is lots of deadfall that make this slow going and unless you are interested in following an old road it may be easier to go back the way you came. 

The trail that goes from Baldy Town camp and Black Horse camp appears to have once been a road. As one hikes it the remains of small side roads can be seen most don’t go far and, but they typically will lead you to either the ruins of a small cabin or the collapsed portal of an old mine. Many small mines can be seen by bushwhacking from near Ute Meadows to the BT-BH trail. On the trail from Baldy Town to Ute Meadows a large scree field can be seen on the northwest side of the trail. There is an old path leading up into this and at the end there are the remains of the tailing pile and portal of what is likely the Montezuma mine. According to papers in the Cyphers geologist box the claims in the area were for 300ft. I recall seeing many small mines in the area between Black Horse, Baldy Town, and Ute Meadows about 300ft from each other.
There are enough cabins within this area towards BT that it is likely the sight of the poorer district of Baldytown as well.

At the intersection of the trail up Baldy and the trail to Black Horse there are several collapsed mines, trash piles, and machinery. There are collapsed mines on either side of the trail there and up towards Baldy. At the top of the hill at Black Horse there are several buildings that have been recently repaired and the remains of the Black Horse Mine (482394.26E, 4052217.99N / 36.615320, -105.196883). The view from the tailing pile is fantastic. If one follows the old trail up the hill from the mine you will come to the foundations of a building and an ore cart. Between the cabins and Black Horse camp the cable leading from the mine to the mill can be seen lying in the trail. At the base of the switchbacks there are the remains of a structure. 

North of Baldytown the Aztec mines can be clearly seen as the large dark grey tailing piles on the hill. Hiking the contour road will allow you to see several tailing piles from the road and will cross the firebreak. If one instead hikes up the old trail towards Copper Park you will pass several mining trails. These lead to a series of collapsed portals to the East and several more to the West. Also to the west are several sets of machinery and a stream flowing from a mine. If one continues on the trail heading west you will come to a switch back and the remains of a structure. This structure’s roof is one of three that can be seen on Google Maps. If one instead follows the firebreak from the contour road they will eventually cross the trail to Copper. If you continue you will reach the Panther Shack, which is a pair of structures near the firebreak. From what I can tell the Panther Shack stands at the location of several vertical shafts from the Aztec-Ponil. This is a private claim not owned by Philmont so don’t mess with things. Continuing past here will lead to you beginning to climb the mountain from the steep side, which isn’t recommended. However, if you were to you would likely come across the collapsed cabin on the southeast side of Baldy. This is not the same cabin that is typically passed on the way off the mountain headed towards Copper Park.

To the west of the trail to Copper a metal roof can be seen about 300ft off the trail. It is not clear what this is, but it is visible in Google Maps. Several small mines can be seen in this area as well as several trash piles and old roads. These crisscross the area in-between French and Baldy so it is not recommended to take them with out a GPS.

#### FRENCH HENRY
On the North side of Baldytown lies Aztec Ridge, then the Ponil stream and then Copper ridge. The Aztec-Ponil gets its name from the multiple adits from both sides that met in the middle to form a mine complex. This means the tailings on the Aztec side lead to the same mines as those near French. There is extensive stopeing in parts of the mine as miners would have sought to extract as much of the ore as they could, however faults limited how far they could tunnel to the north meaning some ore was never exploited. 

There were not as many portals on the Ponil side however the only remaining un-collapsed portal is here and this is the Aztec-Ponil #2 that is used for program. The useable area used to extend further, however there were some minor collapse that mean the ‘Ballroom’ that he original legacy boards were placed in is now inaccessible.

If one were to hike to from French towards Pueblano you would pass the remains of a cabin as well as evidence of some hydraulic mining. There are also traces of roads and the remains of cabins, however these are likely from the loggers.

Heading from French to Copper Park on would pass several mines on both sides of the trail. If one knows what to look for additional cabin remains can be found near the A-P #2 portal and a staff trail leads to #1’s portal and tailings. At the trail intersection to the mine the remains of a cabin are readily apparent. On the way to the portal the collapsed entrance to another mine can be seen. Above the A-P portal there are some trails and concrete rubble.

Past intersection there are several more tailings piles that can be seen from the trail. Some of theses still have recognizable portals ant others are quite large. In addition to the mines there are several ruins of structures and the remains of the roads crisscrossing between French and Baldytown can be seen.

### COPPER PARK 
#### DEEP TUNNEL MINE
*(481648.18E, 4054924.18N / 36.639702, -105.205291)* 

Copper is home to several traces of mining. The largest of which is the remains of the Deep Tunnel Mine. The mine once passed through the entire mountain and was dug in an attempt to reach gold deposits that were thought to be at the center of the mountain. The tunnel was dug from both ends and met in the middle with less than a foot of deviation. No gold was found. The mine can be reached by heading along the south Ponil towards the trail up Baldy. If one keeps an eye out to the left a large tailing pile and some modern trash can be seen from the trail. Climbing up the tailing pile will get you to the collapsed portal and cabin, but it is very steep and there are easier ways to get up there. If you continue down the trail until you see a non-Philmont wooden sign on a tree you can take the old road up to the mine. At the sign turn left and follow the remains of the ruts. Saplings have come up in the middle but the shape of the road can still be seen. The cabin is faced with sheet metal and is in good shape compared to most of the ones you’ll see in the area. The portal has collapsed, but a water tube can be seen running out of the mine. This seems to be the source of water for the spigots at Copper Park camp. The tailing pile and the cabin can be easily seen as one descends from Baldy along Copper Ridge.

#### COPPER PARK CAMP
At the camp itself there are the remains of a tank of some kind near the Red Roof nearest to the trail to French. There are also traces of structures near deep tunnel’s road and along the south Ponil. There are several lengths of pipe in the stream; however there does not seem to have been any notable hydraulic mining in the camp. There are the usual piles of old tin cans from mining areas as well. The trail from Copper passes several mines that may include the Smuggler, Rebel Chief and Yellow Dog Mines.

#### GOAT SCRAMBLE
The goat scramble is an old route off Baldy. It can be seen from Copper Ridge and in Google Maps. It appears to follow the elongated side of Baldy for a ways before diving into the tree line (~1/2 mi from the copper’s meadow) towards the scree field southwest of Copper Park. If one heads away from the populated area of Baldy heading east you will see the start of the trail on the left and if you go far enough there is a Bar P Crazy S, the number 29, and a Zia made out of white rocks right before the mountain gets very steep very fast. From this point the ruined cabin near the firebreak is to the southeast (481629.40E, 4054377.01N).
















Leave No Trace Champs

 


#### MYSTIC
*(480715.01E, 4053819.28N / 36.629723, -105.215702)*
 I have heard the name Mystic used to refer to all of the mines above the tree line, just the one near the ruined cabin, and mines further west, but this is the one that I’ll refer to as Mystic as I’ve seen more things calling it this than any other site. The cabin is the most obvious feature of this and crews heading off Baldy frequently pass it. A tailing pile of copper rich ore can be seen above the cabin and the portal to the mine can still be seen a few feet to the west. There are also several pits past the cabins that were likely used to determine if the spot was worth a full fledged mine. There also appears to be the foundation of another structure off the road to the west a little ways. On the other side of Baldy there are a few collapsed portals with logs still protruding and their tailings can be seen easily in Google Maps. They are the two paler spots near the trail on the south face of Baldy. 


#### OLD FRENCH
*(482903.73N, 4054971.50E/ 36.640152, -105.191247)* The current location of French Henry camp is the location of the mill built to process ore from the French Henry mine to the northwest. The path of the ore cart can be clearly seen in Google Maps. Older Philmont maps show a road going from Copper Park to Old French. If it was a road at some point it is not one any longer. To find it go to the trail to Copper Park and stand at the start of the trail to French. Walk slowly backwards towards French and keep your eye on the campsite sign. Just after you can no longer see it look around the north side of the trail for an old board and a pile of rocks in the shape of an F.







This is what the board looks like

 

Looking back at Copper Park. The sign is just behind the bend.

 

From here head up the hill short ways until the remains of a path appear. There is a single switchback, but for the most part the trail heads straight towards the location of Old French. When you pass a sign that says it is closed you are most of the way there.

The Ore Cart Path is the line in the trees connecting French Henry to French Henry Ridge in this picture.

 

The remains of the buildings there are in rough shape, but are still clearly buildings. The stove on one is still present. Unfortunately a thunderstorm cut my time there short so I was not able to explore very thoroughly, but the remains of a portal and a shaft can be seen, however it seems likely that the shaft was for ventilation.

The legend of French Henry is that Henry Buruel (or Berdeaux, or possibly Henry Ashbaugh, or even some combination owning it at different times) purchased “Jack’s Claim” (thediggings.com) on the north side of the south Ponil on the previously relatively unproductive Copper Ridge in 1869. Surprisingly he struck gold, but Maxwell wouldn’t let him use the Aztec mill to process it. In order for the ore to get him a profit, he needed to mill it before shipping it out. He struck a deal with Maxwell in which he could suspend operations and leave the mine under Maxwell’s protection while he raised money and had a mill built. Maxwell being Maxwell started mining Henry’s ore as soon as he left. When the Henry returned after the mill was finished he reached Baldytown only to hear that Maxwell was stealing his ore. It was too late to head over so he stayed at the hotel and tried to drown his anger, but he only got more and more furious at Maxwell. Determined to see if what he heard was true he grabbed a lantern and set out in the night to go see his mine. When he reached the mill he climbed into an ore cart and started the winch to avoid climbing up the 1200ft slope. As the cart carried him up the gentle rocking, the warm summer breeze, and the alcohol put him to sleep. His cart reached the top and started back down. When it reached the mill Henry weighed enough that the cart dumped its load into the mill and Henry was crushed by the ore stamps, with only an arm clutching a lantern remaining when it was over. Miners were a superstitious bunch and this didn’t sit well with them and the mines reputation for hauntings grew so that they eventually refused to continue digging. Staff have claimed to hear footsteps when no one else is present and seeing a lantern in the night as evidence that that the curse continues. In 2017 the sense of unease supposedly reached a point where a chaplain came to pray over the Aztec-Ponil and French Henry Mines after a staffer found a miner’s tag in her pocket and felt something pull her suspenders. 

This may contain some truth, however from what I understand the mill was built later than the height of the mining days in the 70’s and operations continued at the mine at least until the late 1890’s. Newer work appears to have been done to seal of the shaft and from what I’ve heard another adit has PVC pipes as ventilation and has a mostly intact portal.

### CITO DISTRICT
*The Cito Mining district did not enjoy the same prosperity that the Baldy area did.  One source I found in the geologist box at Cypher’s (which is a treasure trove if you are interested in mining history) stated that the average value of the ore from the Cito area was about 10$/ton compared the nearly 60$/ton ore the north produced. This meant that the area was never as crowded as the north and is home to fewer mines. The most prominent in the heyday of the gold rush were the Grey Eagle (Thunder) and Red Jacket (Contention) mines. The name changes occurred when they were bought from their original owners and reopened. Some smaller mines can be found to the west of the north portal to the Thunder. These are the Garst and the Gloria mines. These two are significantly smaller than the Contention or the Thunder and the Garst may be the smallest named mine on Philmont with a depth of about 50ft. The Gloria is larger at about 150ft.*

#### CONTENTION
The portal used for mine tours is not the original. It was dug for the BSA by a company investigating the remaining gold on Philmont’s land and replaced the collapsed portal that can be seen sloping up and northwest at the first bend in the mine. The tailings for the first entrance can be seen from the current one and from the aptly named muckshack ‘Tailings End’.

#### THUNDER
The Thunder mine appears to have been the largest southern mine and passed straight through the ridge connecting the Middle Fork and North Fork valleys. The Thunder had one portal on the north side of the ridge that has been closed and can be reached from the trail that starts behind the staff cabin. If one were to continue on this trail it would pass the Garst and Gloria mines and head to the old trail connecting Cyphers and Lamberts. If one were to walk straight up the hill you would pass the southern portals on the descent. The mine’s southern most portal was minor and is near the trail at Lamberts. The middle portal has collapsed on its self and has become a pit. The old sweat lodge is at the base of the Thunder’s northern tailings pile. 
Profile of the Thunder

 


Near the Thunder mine to the southwest and along the ridge there are several cabins in poor condition. These were likely the living quarters of the miners in the area. Unfortunately, I do not have their exact location and have been unable to locate them, but have seen enough pictures to know that if you stumble upon them you will know it. Slightly subtler are several old structures on the southern side of the ridge. At least on appears to have been burned. Additionally the original trail connecting Lamberts and Cyphers can be followed from near the top of the ridge to the west of the Thunder several hundred feet to the current trail connecting Lamberts and Comanche Pass. The current trail is actually the road used to transport ore from the mine. The Middle Fork trail follows this road’s path as well. An interesting tidbit about the Lamberts-Cyphers road/trail is that near the tip of the hairpin turn there is another trail that descends straight towards the Middle Fork. This path has ax cut logs indicating that it likely predates the BSA. The trail can be seen easiest headed from Lamberts to Cyphers and looking to the right at the turn. There are some small cairns at the start of the trail.

#### CYPHERS CAMP
In the camp itself several structures appear to have come from either the early scouts or the late miners. One building is known to be an original and that is the stomp cabin. This dates from the era of Charlie Cyphers and was rebuilt in the summer of 2017 to keep it from sliding down the hill. The cabin was used by Cyphers and some interesting finds were made during the rebuild. Several shoes were found beneath the cabin and magazine pages were found crumpled between logs.
