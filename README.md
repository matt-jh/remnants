## What’s Left of Philmont’s Past
*As the focus of Philmont has shifted from western lore to backpacking to program at staffed camps most of the physical remains of Colfax County’s past have become something of an afterthought. One does not need a spade or brush to uncover the wooden skeletons of mining camps, the metal bones of railroads or the forgotten paths of the land’s previous stewards- they are laying there on the surface for those who care to see them.*
