## The Ranchers
*Gold was not the only industry that brought people to the area in the second half of the 1800’s. The cattle industry was growing and changing the west. The days of the mountain man were numbered and the era of the cowboy was beginning.*

#### THE CHASE FAMILY
Manly and Teresa Chase moved to the area from Wisconsin and made a deal with Maxwell in which they would catch wild horses and sell them to him for 10$ worth of land. Eventually they acquired enough to start a ranch and expanded to include 25,000 acres. Through sales and gambling loses the ranch is currently down to 11,000. Like Cimarron, plenty of historical figures made an appearance in the ranch’s history. From the local Apache chief to Charles Goodnight of cowboy and chuck wagon fame, to the General-Governor-Author Lew Wallace who worked on part of his book Ben Hurr while staying in the area. The Families world fair winning apples grew along the Ponil stream and Philmont is hoping to restore the orchard after years of neglect and the removal of many to make way for the railroad. The ranch house is original and many of the buildings on the ranch show their age. The Chase Canyon road is also one of the sites where cowboy graffiti can be seen. If one keeps an eye over their right shoulder as they head from the highway to the campsites you may see it on the large blocks near the entrance to the canyon.

#### STONE WALL PASS
Stone Wall pass gets its name from the stone wall running over it. The wall was originally a divider between ranches before Waite Phillips bought all the ranches that existed on what is now Philmont.

#### WAITE PHILLIPS
While his Villa Philmonte was the grandest lodge he built on the property, Waite also had several built in the backcountry. Crater Lake (a place to stop overnight when headed to Fish Camp), Hunting Lodge, and Fish Camp (Rayado lodge) are all home to Phillips’ backcountry homes. He also built a reservoir near the current Philmont reservoir. It is much smaller and looks natural apart from a concrete dam that can be easily missed. The dam has Waite’s initials and the year – 1927 – carved into it. The current site of bas camp was the site of Phillips’ cattle headquarters and has some older foundations visible, however it isn’t clear if these are from the Phillips era or from the Scouts.
