## The Loggers & Railroaders
*I’ve grouped these two together due to the close relations between the two. While they also were tied to the mining in the more permanent nature of mining meant there was much more to include in that section. Logging was needed to supply the wood for the mines and the mining settlements. Railways were needed to move the logs. Logging was needed for railroad ties making it difficult for one industry to exist without the other two. Logging was done most notably to use near the mining areas in the north near the South Ponil, however logs were also harvested from the other Ponil canyons and the Valle Vidal in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Additionally there has been logging in the south country more recently.*

#### PONIL STREAMS 
The branches of the Ponil all have ties to the logging industry ranging from railroads to extract the logs to the sites where they were felled. The most obvious is Pueblano and its logging history program, which like Crater Lake portrays the Continental Tie and Lumber Company. The CT&L Co. was a real company that was run by the same man (T.A. Schomberg) as the Cimarron and Northwestern Railway. The C&N ran 22 miles from Cimarron to Ponil Park in the Valle Vidal and had an additional 5 miles of spurs for pulling logs to the main line.

The most oblivious reminder of this era is the rail bed that is clearly visible in the North Ponil. This was the rail bed used by the C&N from 1907 to the end of the railway in the early 1920s. Some ties remain, as do many spikes. The rail bed is the leveled and graded path that can be seen at several points on the hike from IW to Metcalf. Ponil Park is in ruins and is easy to miss, but there are the ruins of several cabins there as well as a cemetery.

The photos come from some of these sites ([1][1], [2][2] and [3][3] ← these guys took  the goat scramble up Baldy). They have many more interesting pictures, both recent and from the late 60’s of Philmont and the Valle Vidal.

Over in the Middle Ponil there are some rail spikes that can be found and it seems likely that they may have been short term spurs in the area. Between the North and Middle Ponil Stream and south of Ring Place is Ring Town. This was another lumber settlement that there are only ruins left of today. It does not seem to have as many crews a passing by as Ponil Park. The remains of at least three buildings are clearly visible in Google Maps and there is another cemetery to the east of the ruins. There is a map at Metcalf that shows the rail route and the logging camps like Ponil Park and Ring Town, but I was a fool and didn’t take a picture of it.

Debris At Ring Town

In the South Ponil the most numerous remains of the logging era can be found. The area around what is now Pueblano was used for logging and at the site of Pueblano Ruins camp there are the remains of a logging camp. These can be found off the trail a small ways.
 
Pueblano ruins is true to its name and does have the remains of a logging camp. The temporary cabins can be seen near the north side of the camp closer to the trail running from French to Peublano, however compared to the cabins that can be seen on the trail from Copper to French these are easy to miss. Additionally there are fragments from ceramics in the area. I found some fragments from blue and white china near the intersection on the north side of the trail. In the same region between Peublano and Head of Dean there are the remains of a cabin, presumably from the logging operations in the area.

#### OTHER SITES
New Dean had the remains of some logging machinery, including what appeared to be the remains of a steam donkey or some kind of boiler. There was logging in the area however the flood of 2015 hit this area especially hard and there may not be much visible to show for this.

Flume canyon was the site of a flume to remove the logs harvested from Wilson Mesa and bring them to roads. Supposedly the remains of the flume can still be seen at the head of the canyon.

Cimarron Canyon was the site of a spur line and the home of a railroad waystation. This eventually developed into the Cimarroncita Ranch for Girls and was purchased by Philmont in 2015. There are numerous remains form the girls camp era, but the road seems to have taken the same route as the railway so little can be seen. Cimarron Canton was also one of the locations where the Johnny Depp Lone Ranger movie was filmed with part of the ending train fight being filmed in the canyon near the Palisades. 

Rich Cabins has the remains of some lighter track near the road that heads up the hill between them and Dan Beard. The rails are muck smaller than standard locomotive gauge, but may have been from something lighter like an ore cart or a means of removing logs.

#### MODERN LOGGING
The areas around Miner’s Park and Lover’s Leap Camp have had logging activity in the recent past. However much of the Ranch has or will have some logging done to reduce the timber buildup that could lead to a catastrophic fire. In the area between Crooked Creek, Apache Springs, and PJ there is a maze of old logging roads and clearings that the current trails cross and follow. 

In the wake of the 2018 Ute Park and Morris Creek fires Philmont has expanded its forestry initiatives. This means that staff and lumber companies will be cutting and processing more than they have in the recent past.
