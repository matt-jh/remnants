##The Homesteaders
# TODO: ADD IMAGES
*The promises of the West brought people and families into the canyons of the area. Some of them left traces that can still be seen today. Some of the canyons in the area supposedly hold the names of families that settled there or names relating to their time there. These as said to include Abran and Metcalf canyons. Metcalf is named after a sheriff who was killed in the canyon.*
#### THE RICH FAMILY
Originally from the Tyrol region of Austria the Rich family traveled to the United States in the late 19th Century and settled in the Middle Ponil Canyon. They built a homestead where the camp currently stands and, according to the staff, eventually combined their cabins into the cabin that stands today. This is possibly the reason why there is only one cabin, but the camp is named Rich Cabins. 

The Rich family was active in a variety of industries including trapping and mining, however they are best known for their ranching. They were the original owners of the heart brand that the Chase Ranch now uses.
The family lived at the homestead for nearly forty years before leaving in 1920. The property was eventually acquired by Ted Turner as part of his massive Vermejo Park Ranch and for a while was just another relic on that property. The land was not always part of Philmont's program area, and I have heard stories of its porch being used as a place to crash on the way back to the Ranch from Costilla from former staff and the agreement to use the Greenwood Tract is comparatively recent. 

The staff cabin is the original cabin used by the family and the barn appears to be as well. There used to be a windmill next to the barn, however that had broken and the top fell off. In the area between Ponil and Rich the remains of a building can be found along the road. Google Maps identifies this as the Stern Post office; unfortunately I don't know any of its history. As one comes down the trail from Dan Beard you will pass several rails that appear too small to be for a regular railroad. My assumption is that they are lighter rail for an ore cart left over from the gold and coal mining that was done in the area.

#### THE RING FAMILY
Ring Place stands on the site of Timothy Rings homestead. The building is in poor condition, but I have heard that Cabin Restoration has done some work on it and will likely do more in the near future. Since the area is on public land the Forest Service has put up quite a few signs around the camp with information about the family and the history of the place. Besides the cabin a few things remain in the area. One that seems very likely to be from the same era as the homestead is a trash pile in the woods to the East just out side of camp. It appears that it was a dumping ground for the family's trash and the metal frames of some items remain. There is also a small wooden foundation to the East of the house although there isn't enough left to tell what it was.

#### THE ABREU FAMILY
The Abreu family was related by marriage to Maxwell and settled in the area near Rayado. The family cemetery stands behind that camp. The family's home once stood at the site of the Old Abreu trail camp and the foundations of some of those buildings can still be seen if one wanders around the camp. Unfortunately the buildings burned down at some point. Abreu became Old Abreu, and New Abreu became Abreu. The buildings at the current camp have been built over the years by Cabin Restoration. 

Jesus Abreu had an interesting life that included taking the Santa Fe trail East , fighting in the Mexican American war, and prospecting in California during the gold rush. He worked in the Rayado store before marrying one of Beaubien's daughters and founding a ranch in the 1860s. He died in 1900 and his family sold of the majority of the land in 1911.

#### ZASTROW
Zastrow is named after an  easter european immigrant who lived in the area where the camp now lies. I have not found when he lived there or where his home was.

#### CLAYTON CABIN
South of Clayton Corrals at 476094.35E, 4067855.84N there is a cabin. It is presumably named after the same Clayton as the corrals and is supposedly in awful shape. Cabin restoration supposedly worked on it recently, however the reason for this is unclear. Some rumors that I have heard claim the USFS is interested in us opening a staffed camp at this location, due to the amount of conservation work scouts could perform in the area. If this is true I have no idea what the timeframe involved would be.
