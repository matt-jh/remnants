## The Trappers
*Around the time wagons began lumbering down the Santa Fe Trail the Rocky Mountain Fur trade began to grow into a major enterprise. The hub of the southern fur trade was Taos and given the close proximity of Philmont it is likely that some trapping took place on Philmont’s land. Trapping is not a sedimentary trade and the camps they would have erected and the trails that they walked would have been temporary. There are some claims that the cabin at Black Mountain Camp was built by brothers hoping to trap the area. I have heard this story for the cabin there more than any other and on that I will count it as a remnant of the trapping days, albeit from after the trade’s boom in the 1820’s and 30’s.*

#### NEAR BLACK MOUNTAIN SITE #7
At Black Mountain camp the cabin still stands, although the modern age has come with some additions such as a radio antenna. If one goes to campsite #7 and climbs the hill to the PtoB overlooking it the remains of a series of trail blazes can be seen. They are in the form of scraping done to remove a chunk of the tree so that one can see the scar of the next blaze when standing near the previous. If one heads to the southwest from the PtoB there is also an unusual flat area. This may be the future location of the range if it is decided shooting lead over a water source is a poor choice. If the blazes are followed they will lead one up the hill to the vicinity of the contour road. It is highly likely that this was the original route out of the valley.

Tree with carvings near the PtoB. Probably more recent than the cabins as they are in an aspen.

Also in the vicinity of campsite 7 there are two patches of stones piled up several inches high, about two feet wide and around six feet long. It is highly probable that these are graves.

The two are similar however one is significantly more scattered than the other. The scattered one is fairly close to the PtoB to the southeast.

One of the rock piles. This is the less grave-like.

#### RAYADO
Kit Carson is one of, if not the, best-known mountain man from the fur trapping age. He roamed from DC to California so its not too surprising that he found himself in what would later be Colfax County. Kit had met Lucien Maxwell when he had been a guide for John C. Fremont in Mexico (particularly in what is now California). Maxwell settled at the mouth of the Rayado Canyon near the Santa Fe Trail in 1848 and convinced Kit to join him a year later. They did some farming and ranching and eventually a unit of dragoons (troops that ride to battle, but fight dismounted) was stationed there. Carson did not stay here too long, but Maxwell stayed in the area and eventually developed the region into a virtual fiefdom.

Maxwell’s house still stands near the dining hall and has undergone some restoration, including ranger workdays in 2013.

Behind the current structures lies the Abreu Family Cemetery and several piles of dirt from the construction of the modern buildings. The dirt pile has had some sifting for artifacts and has produced minor finds.
